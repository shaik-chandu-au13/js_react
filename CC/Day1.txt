Challenge 1: Volume and Surface Area of a Cylinder
Write a program that:

Declares two variables radius and height to store the radius and height of a cylinder.
Calculates the volume and surface area of the cylinder using the formulas:
Volume = π * radius^2 * height (use 3.14 for π)
Surface Area = 2 * π * radius * (radius + height)
Prints the volume and surface area.
Example:
bash
Copy code
Input:
radius = 5
height = 10

Output:
Volume: 785.0
Surface Area: 471.0




Challenge 2: Sum of First N Natural Numbers (Using Formula)
Write a program that:

Declares a variable n to store the number of terms.
Uses the formula to calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers:
Sum = n * (n + 1) / 2
Prints the sum.
Example:
bash
Copy code
Input:
n = 100

Output:
Sum: 5050




Challenge 3: Compound Interest Calculation
Write a program that:

Declares four variables principal, rate, time, and n (number of times interest is compounded per year).
Calculates the compound interest using the formula:
Amount = principal * (1 + rate / (n * 100)) ^ (n * time)
Compound Interest = Amount - Principal
Prints the compound interest and the total amount.
Example:
bash
Copy code
Input:
principal = 1000
rate = 5
time = 2
n = 4

Output:
Compound Interest: 104.3
Total Amount: 1104.3




Challenge 4: BMI Calculator
Write a program that:

Declares two variables weight (in kg) and height (in meters).
Calculates the BMI using the formula:
BMI = weight / (height^2)
Prints the BMI.
Example:
bash
Copy code
Input:
weight = 70
height = 1.75

Output:
BMI: 22.86
