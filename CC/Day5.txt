Question:
Write a function combinedEvenOdd that takes an array of integers as input. The function should return an object with the following properties:

even: an array of all even numbers from the input.
odd: an array of all odd numbers from the input.
evenSum: the sum of all even numbers.
oddSum: the sum of all odd numbers.
For example, given the array:

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
The function should return:

{
  even: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10],
  odd: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9],
  evenSum: 30,
  oddSum: 25
}
