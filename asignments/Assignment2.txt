Number Guessing Game with Loops and Conditions
Create a number guessing game where:

The computer randomly picks a number between 1 and 100.
The user has to guess the number using a while loop.
After each guess, the program should give a hint:
If the guess is less than the target, print "Too Low!".
If the guess is more than the target, print "Too High!".
The loop should break if the user guesses correctly.
After 10 failed attempts, the program should end and print "Game Over".
