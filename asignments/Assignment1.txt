HTML Assignment: Create a Personal Webpage
Objective:
Create a simple webpage about yourself using basic HTML elements. The webpage should include headings, paragraphs, links, images, lists, and tables. This exercise will help you practice structuring content with HTML tags.


Task 1: HTML Document Structure
Create an HTML file (index.html) that follows the basic HTML structure:

The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration at the top.
The <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.
Inside the <head>, include a <title> tag to set the webpage's title.


Task 2: Add Headings and Paragraphs
In the body of the document:

Use at least three levels of headings (<h1>, <h2>, <h3>).
Write a few sentences about yourself in two separate paragraphs using the <p> tag.
Example: Your hobbies, favorite books, or a short bio.


Task 3: Add an Image
Include an image using the <img> tag:

Find an image (a profile picture or any image relevant to you) and place it inside the same folder as your HTML file.
Use the <img> tag to display the image on your webpage.
Example: <img src="profile.jpg" alt="My Profile Picture" width="300">


Task 4: Create a List
Add an unordered list (<ul>) or ordered list (<ol>) to list your favorite things:

Create a list of your favorite books, movies, or hobbies.
Use the <li> tag to add items inside the list.


Task 5: Add Links
Include two types of links on your page:

A link to another webpage (e.g., a link to your favorite website, using the <a> tag).
Example: <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit my favorite website</a>
An anchor link that links to another section within your webpage (use an id attribute on a section and link to it).


Task 6: Create a Table
Create a table to display your skills or qualifications using the <table> tag:

Add two columns: Skill and Experience (Years).
Add at least three rows.
Use the <th> tag for table headings and <td> for table data.

Task 7: Inline Styling (Optional)
For extra practice, use inline styles to change the color or font size of some text:

Example: <h1 style="color: blue;">About Me</h1>


Deliverables:

A fully functional HTML file (index.html) containing:
Proper document structure (<!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <body>)
Headings and paragraphs
An image with the <img> tag
A list (unordered or ordered)
Two types of links
A table
Optional inline styles


Bonus Task (Optional):
Create a simple form at the bottom of your page with input fields for a name and email and a submit button. Use the <form>, <input>, and <button> tags.


Submission Guidelines:
Submit the index.html file.
Ensure all content (text, images, etc.) is structured neatly.
Make sure to test the webpage by opening the file in a web browser.


This assignment will help you become familiar with the basics of HTML and understand how to structure a webpage effectively.
